# Enhanced-LCZ42-Ensembles-to-EdgeAI-Axelera-Metis

> Improved deep ensembles for Local Climate Zone mapping with knowledge distillation and deployment on Axelera Metis Edge AI accelerator.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This repository extends the work of [Nanni & Brahnam, 2025] on **deep CNN ensembles for LCZ classification** (So2Sat LCZ42 dataset).  
We make two main contributions:
1. **Improving the ensemble baseline** with optimized training and fusion strategies for higher accuracy and robustness.  
2. **Compressing ensembles into efficient student models** via knowledge distillation, quantization, and pruning, enabling deployment on **Axelera Metis AI accelerator** for embedded applications.
